# breast-cancer-detection: classification problem

-This notebook consists of basic EDA and modelling using 2 famous classification ML models:
    1.LogisticRegression
    2.RandomForestClassifier 

-Firstly it covers the simple EDA of the dataset. The dataset used is taken from uci-ml repo: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29

-Then modelling is done using 3 ML techniques to obtain the baseline metrics. 

-Decision tree model is then dropped, as the other 2 models perform well.

-Hyperparameter tuning, done for LogisticRegression and RandomForestClassifier models to further improve the accuracy score and other metrics.
